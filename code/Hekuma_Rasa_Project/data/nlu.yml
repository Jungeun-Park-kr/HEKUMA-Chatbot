# NLU training data stores structured information about user messages.
# The goal of NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is to extract structured
# information from user messages. This usually includes the user's intent and
# any entities their message contains. You can add extra information such as
# regular expressions and lookup tables to your training data to help the model
# identify intents and entities correctly.
