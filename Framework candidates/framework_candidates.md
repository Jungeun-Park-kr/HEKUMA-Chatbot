# Chatterbot

- is a python library
- easy to use
- lightweight

---

# But...

- no voice integration
- a lot of coding has to be done (maintaining and voice input)
- latest stable release pushed 1 year ago

---

# Tock

- Tock Studio user interface to build stories (learning) and analytics
- Programming also possible in Typescript besides Python
- Still maintained on github but fairly small community (40 Contributors)

---

# But...

- no voice integration
- its just the NLP 
-> has to be combined with a machine learning framework (e.g. Rasa, tensorflow)

---

# Botshot (Golem)

- no voice integration
- only works for certain platforms right now (e.g. whatsapp)
- very small team contributing to the project (3 People)
- lightweight

---

# DeepPavlov

- Still maintained on github but fairly small community (66 Contributors)
- no voice integration
- pre-trained NLP models

---

# Rasa Stack

- pre-trained NLP models
- Highly maintained (600+ contributors)
- Supports Text and Voice
 
- But python only!

---

# Rasa comes up with 2 components

## Rasa NLU

a library for natural language understanding (NLU) which does the classification of intent and extract the entity from the user input and helps bot to understand what the user is saying.

## Rasa Core

a chatbot framework with machine learning-based dialogue management which takes the structured input from the NLU and predicts the next best action
