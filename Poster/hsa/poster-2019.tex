%%% Now define the boxes that make up the poster

%%% Each box has a name and can be placed absolutely or relatively.
%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position 
%%% towards an already declared box. So if you have a box attached to the 
%%% bottom, one to the top and a third one which should be in between, you 
%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle 
%%% box.

\headerbox{Motivation}{name=problem,column=0,row=0}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Today we are in the fourth industrial revolution or also known as Industry 4.0, where virtual 
and physical manufacturing systems cooperate with each other in a flexible way on a global level 
(Pistorius, 2020, p.5). There are many virtual assistants on the market for home automation and personal tasks. (Petrock, 2020)
The motivation of our project was to also explore the chances of voice assistants for Industry 4.0.
